**Proximal Alternating Reweighted Minimization for Multiplicative Noise Removal, Version 2.0**

Please refer to the following our paper:

Xiaoxia Liu, Jian Lu, Lixin Shen, Chen Xu, and Yuesheng Xu, "Multiplicative noise removal: Nonlocal low-rank model and its proximal alternating reweighted minimization algorithm," SIAM J. Imag. Sci., vol. 13, no. 3, pp. 1595â€“1629, 2020.

This demo is the PARM algorithm for multiplicative noise removal. The program using parallel computing is expected to run on high-performance computers with multi-core processors. 

For other applications, you may modify 
1. the initialization and correction in PARM_Denoising;
2. the fidelity function in XEstimation;
3. the low-rank regularizer in PatEstimation.
