% This demo is the PARM algorithm for multiplicative noise removal. 
% The program using parallel computing is expected to run on 
% high-performance computers with multi-core processors. 
%  
% For other applications, you may modify 
% 1. the initialization and correction in PARM_Denoising;
% 2. the fidelity function in XEstimation;
% 3. the low-rank regularizer in PatEstimation.
